# IITM-BS--Grpa
This repository is for the weekly Graded Programming Assignments of IITM BS Degree.
This is specifically for python Term-3 Jan 2025- April 2025.

# Week-1 :

GrPA 1 - Numbers (Arithemetic) - GRADED
Solve the below tasks related to Numbers.

Tasks 1 to 3 - building up Arithemetic expression
Tasks 4 and 5 - floating point arithemetic
Tasks 6 and 7 - modulo and floor division
Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation

GrPA2 - Numbers (Relational and Logical) - GRADED
Solve all the below tasks related to relational and logical operators.

This exercise gives you practice in building up boolean expressions.

Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation

GrPA 3 - Strings (Indexing and Slicing) - GRADED
Solve all the below tasks related to indexing and slicing.

Keep in mind ðŸ§  The concept of indexing and slicing will come again in later weeks with list and tuple which are also sequences like string.

This exercise gives you practice in different indexing and slicing methods.

Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation

GrPA 4 - Strings (Concatenation, repetition, and substring check) - GRADED
Solve all the below tasks related to string concatenation, repeatition and substring check in strings.

Problem Type: Input variable - Output Variable, Hidden suffix for evaluation

GrPA5 - I/O and Type Conversion - GRADED
Get age(int), dob(str of format "dd/mm/yy") and weight(float) from the standard input and print the tenth_month, fifth_birthday and last_birthday formatted as "day/month/year"(do not include the preceeding zero for single digit number) separated by comma and a space a single line and print the weight_readable(str formatted as "55 kg 200 grams")

Note: while formatting dates you may have to convert back int to str using the type conversion. There is something called as "f-strings" or "formatted strings" that will help us format things by automatically doing type conversion. This will be covered in later weeks. But you can explore that (Google or ChatGPT) and compare the difference.

Note: The last_birthday depends on the dob and age. For example if the dob is "20/02/2001" and the age is 5 the last birthday will be "20/02/2006".

Note: Finding the tenth_month will be a bit of challange. If you are stuck open the below hint.

Hint for tenth_month
Explanation

When you're adding months to a date, you need to make sure that the month number doesn't go beyond 12, because there are only 12 months in a year.

Starting from Zero:
Think of months like positions on a number line that starts at zero instead of one (because modulo cycles from 0 to n-1). January is 0, February is 1, and so on.
When you subtract 1 from a month, you're basically shifting it to this zero-based system. For example, if you start at month 10 (October), subtracting 1 gives you 9.
Using Modulo:
The modulo operation helps to wrap around when you go past December. So, 13 becomes 1 (January), 14 becomes 2 (February), etc.
The modulo operation works naturally with zero-based numbers. For example, 24 % 12 = 0 means it wraps around to the starting point (January).
Adding 1 Back:
After using the modulo operation, you add 1 back to shift back to the regular month numbering system. This makes sure that months are in the range of 1 to 12.
Example

Let's say it's October (month 10) and you want to find the date 15 months later.

Add the Months:
10 (October) + 15 months = 25.
Convert to Zero-Based and Apply Modulo:
Subtract 1: 25 - 1 = 24.
Apply modulo 12: 24 % 12 = 0.
This means it wraps around to the start of the year.
Convert Back to One-Based:
Add 1: 0 + 1 = 1.
So, itâ€™s January.
Adjust the Year:
Since you added enough months to go into the next year, you need to account for that.
Calculate how many full years youâ€™ve added: (25 - 1) // 12 = 2.
So, if you started in 2022, adding 2 years brings you to 2024.
Result

15 months from October 2022 is January 2024.
